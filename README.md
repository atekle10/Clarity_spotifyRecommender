# Clarity Spotify Recommender

Clarity Spotify Recommender is a Python-based project that uses Spotify API and machine learning to generate personalized music recommendations based on a user's listening preferences.


## Introduction

This project aims to help users discover new music on Spotify by analyzing songs they like and generating a list of songs that match their musical preferences. We achieve this by utilizing the Spotify API to gather song data and using machine learning techniques to recommend similar songs.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository(more specifically: ML_Model.ipynb)
2. Install the required packages:

3. Obtain a [Spotify API key](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and set up the required environment variables.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script or Jupyter notebook to start the recommender system.
2. Follow the prompts to input a spotify song id's (1-10).
3. The recommender system will generate a list of recommended songs based on your input.
